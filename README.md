# FF1 Binary Formats
A catalog of format definitions for the binary files used in Fossil Fighters.

Almost all of the value of this repositiory is in [the wiki](https://github.com/simonomi/FF1_Binary_Formats/wiki). 
The rest is in `binary_documentation.py`, which is a tool to help create pages for the wiki. It's not very polished, so don't expect a lot.
